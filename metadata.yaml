description: '"Running a republic under the economic laws of a monarchy must of necessity
  result in producing the same conditions - great wealth for some and great poverty
  for the rest. This may be a government by the people, but it certainly is no longer
  a government for the people. Heretofore individual greed has had full swing in the
  United States, and naturally enough the ablest returned in possession of everything
  worth grabbing. And naturally enough, too, if a republic means a country owned by
  all its people, it cannot be a republic if it is owned by only a few. All the power
  of a country is bound to be in the hands of those who own it. If its wealth is in
  the hands of a few, its power is there with it.In the hands of a few it must be,
  if it would be a kingdom or empire. " - Book cover.'
